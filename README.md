# My Splunk + Sysmon Detection Lab

This repository contains all the configurations and documentation for a comprehensive security information and event management (SIEM) lab I built. The environment is centered around a full Microsoft Active Directory domain, enabling the simulation and detection of realistic adversary techniques.

This project is documented to serve as a portfolio piece and a detailed blueprint for anyone looking to build their own hands-on detection lab.

## Project Goals

*   **Enterprise Environment Simulation:** To build and configure a multi-server environment with Active Directory, replicating a typical corporate network.
*   **End-to-End Log Collection:** To instrument Windows endpoints with Sysmon and configure Splunk forwarders to centralize security, application, and system logs in Splunk.
*   **Threat Simulation:** To use industry-standard frameworks like **Atomic Red Team** and adversary tools like `crowbar` to execute controlled attacks mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework.
*   **Detection Engineering:** To analyze the generated logs, identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), and build high-fidelity Splunk queries to detect malicious activity.

## ‚ú® Features & Technologies Used

*   **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise 9.2
*   **Directory Service:** Microsoft Active Directory
*   **Endpoint Logging:** Microsoft Sysmon with a modular configuration
*   **Log Forwarding:** Splunk Universal Forwarder
*   **Attack Simulation:** Atomic Red Team, Crowbar (RDP Brute-Forcer)
*   **Virtualization:** Oracle VirtualBox
*   **Operating Systems:** Windows Server 2022, Windows 10, Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux

## üöÄ Full Illustrated Guide

I have written a complete, illustrated step-by-step guide that walks through the entire lab creation process‚Äîfrom setting up the virtual machines and Active Directory to executing and detecting the final attacks.

## üéØ Example Detections Showcase

Here is a quick look at some of the threats this lab can detect. The full tutorial details how to perform the attacks and build the detection logic.
