Of course. The current README.md is a good starting point, but we can make it significantly more impactful for hiring managers and networking.

A great project README should be a self-contained showcase. It needs to immediately grab attention, explain the project's value, demonstrate the process, and highlight the skills you've acquiredâ€”all without forcing the reader to click away to another site.

Here is a completely revamped README.md. It incorporates the detailed guide from your Notion page, adds professional formatting, and is structured to impress.

This project documents the creation of a fully operational security lab designed to simulate a real-world enterprise environment. By integrating Splunk as a SIEM and Sysmon for deep endpoint telemetry, this lab provides a platform for hands-on experience in threat detection, data analysis, and security engineering.

The primary objective is to ingest, parse, and analyze security event data from a Windows endpoint to detect malicious activities simulated using the Atomic Red Team framework, which executes tests based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Lab Architecture

The lab is built on a private virtual network to ensure all simulated attacks are isolated. It consists of two primary machines:

1.  **SIEM Server (Windows Server 2019):** This VM hosts Splunk Enterprise, acting as our centralized logging and analysis platform. It listens for incoming data from our monitored endpoint.
2.  **Victim Endpoint (Windows 10):** This VM represents a typical corporate workstation. It is configured with Sysmon for advanced event logging and a Splunk Universal Forwarder to send this data to the SIEM.

## Project Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Virtual Lab & Network Setup
The foundation of the lab is a properly configured virtual environment.

1.  **VM Creation:** Two VMs were created in VMware: one for Windows Server 2019 (SIEM) and one for Windows 10 (Endpoint).
2.  **Network Isolation:** Both VMs were configured to use a private network segment (`Host-Only` or `LAN Segment`) to isolate them from the host machine and external networks.
3.  **Static IP & Connectivity:** Static IP addresses were assigned to ensure stable communication:
    *   **SIEM Server:** `192.168.10.100`
    *   **Victim Endpoint:** `192.168.10.110`
4.  **Firewall Configuration:** For initial setup, the Windows Defender Firewall was temporarily disabled on both VMs. In a production environment, specific rules for ports `9997` (Splunk data) and `8089` (Splunk management) would be created.
5.  **Connectivity Test:** A `ping` command was used to verify that the two VMs could communicate successfully over the private network.

### Phase 2: Splunk Enterprise (SIEM) Installation
With the server VM ready, Splunk Enterprise was installed and configured.

1.  **Installation:** The Splunk Enterprise `.msi` installer was downloaded and run on the Windows Server 2019 VM. A secure administrator password was created during the setup.
2.  **Configure Data Receiving:** To accept logs from the Universal Forwarder, a data receiving port was enabled in Splunk.
    *   Navigated to **Settings > Forwarding and receiving**.
    *   Configured a new receiving port on `9997`, the default port for Splunk forwarders.

### Phase 3: Sysmon Endpoint Monitoring Setup
To get meaningful data, the Windows 10 endpoint was instrumented with Sysmon.

1.  **Download Sysmon & Config:** The Sysmon utility and a robust configuration file from [SwiftOnSecurity](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) were downloaded. This config file is crucial as it filters out benign system noise, focusing on potentially malicious events.
2.  **Installation:** Using an administrative PowerShell, Sysmon was installed with the custom configuration file. This ensures that the generated logs are rich in security context.
    ```powershell
    # The command used to install Sysmon with a specific configuration
    .\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i C:\Sysmon\sysmonconfig-export.xml
    ```

![Image: Sysmon installation command in PowerShell](images/sysmon-install-command.png)

### Phase 4: Configuring the Splunk Universal Forwarder
A Universal Forwarder (UF) was installed on the Windows 10 endpoint to ship Sysmon logs to the SIEM.

1.  **UF Installation:** The UF installer was run on the Windows 10 VM. During setup, it was configured to point to the SIEM server:
    *   **Deployment Server:** `192.168.10.100:8089`
    *   **Receiving Indexer:** `192.168.10.100:9997`
2.  **Data Input Configuration:** The UF was instructed which logs to monitor. Using the command line, the Sysmon event log was added as a data source.
    ```powershell
    # Navigate to the UF's bin directory
    cd "C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin"

    # Add the Sysmon log source and assign an index and sourcetype
    .\splunk.exe add monitor "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" -index botsv3 -sourcetype "XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"

    # Restart the service to apply changes
    .\splunk.exe restart
    ```

### Phase 5: Verifying Data Ingestion
The final setup step was to confirm that logs were successfully flowing from the endpoint to Splunk.

1.  **Splunk Search:** In the Splunk Search & Reporting app, a query was run to check for data in the newly created index.
    ```spl
    index="botsv3"
    ```
2.  **Confirmation:** Events from the Windows 10 machine appeared in the search results, confirming that the data pipeline was working correctly.

## Threat Simulation & Detection Example

This section demonstrates the core value of the lab: detecting a simulated threat.

### Scenario: PowerShell Download Cradle (T1059.001)
A common attack technique is to use PowerShell to download and execute malicious scripts from the internet. We simulated this using Atomic Red Team.

1.  **Install Atomic Red Team:** The framework was installed on the Windows 10 endpoint via PowerShell.
    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name AtomicRedTeam -Force
    ```
2.  **Execute Test:** The specific test for a PowerShell download cradle was invoked.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-AtomicTest T1059.001 -TestNumbers 3
    ```
    This command safely executes a `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(...)` command, a classic indicator of compromise (IOC).

### Detection with Splunk Processing Language (SPL)
With the "attack" executed, I pivoted to Splunk to hunt for the evidence. Sysmon `EventCode=1` (Process Creation) is perfect for this, as it captures the full command line of every process.

The following SPL query was crafted to find this specific behavior:

```spl
index="botsv3" source="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1 CommandLine="*IEX*"
```

**Query Breakdown:**
*   `index="botsv3"`: Focuses the search on our dedicated index.
*   `EventCode=1`: Filters for only "Process Creation" events from Sysmon.
*   `CommandLine="*IEX*"`: Searches the `CommandLine` field for the presence of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression), a strong indicator of this technique.

**Result:** The query returned the exact event generated by the Atomic Red Team test, successfully detecting the simulated threat. The results clearly showed `powershell.exe` executing the malicious command line.

## Conclusion & Key Skills Demonstrated

This project serves as a practical application of the tools and methodologies used daily in a Security Operations Center (SOC). It successfully established an end-to-end security monitoring pipeline and proved its effectiveness by detecting a simulated TTP.

**Skills and Competencies Showcased:**
*   **SIEM Deployment & Administration:** Installed, configured, and managed a Splunk Enterprise instance for log collection and analysis.
*   **Endpoint Detection & Monitoring:** Deployed and configured Sysmon with custom rules to gain deep visibility into endpoint activity.
*   **Log Management & Data Pipelining:** Established a reliable data flow from an endpoint to a central SIEM using the Splunk Universal Forwarder.
*   **Detection Engineering:** Authored custom detection rules using Splunk Processing Language (SPL) to identify specific malicious behaviors.
*   **Threat Emulation:** Utilized the Atomic Red Team framework to simulate attacker techniques mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
*   **Security Analysis:** Investigated events and distinguished malicious activity from benign system noise.

### Future Improvements
-   **Develop Splunk Alerts:** Convert the detection query into a real-time alert to automate threat notification.
-   **Create Security Dashboards:** Build visualizations to track key security metrics and trends.
-   **Expand Log Sources:** Ingest additional data sources, such as Windows Security Logs, PowerShell logs, and firewall logs, for comprehensive visibility.
-   **Advanced Detections:** Write more complex correlation searches to detect multi-stage attack chains.
