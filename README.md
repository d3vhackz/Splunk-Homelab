# Splunk + Sysmon SIEM Detection Project

## Introduction

This project is going to be the ground layer for a good homelab. At the time I'm writing this, my homelab environment will consist of one Windows 10 machine (as the target machine), one Server 2022 machine (as the Active Directory Domain Controller), one Kali Linux machine (as the attacking machine), and one Ubuntu Linux machine (as the Splunk server). All machines will be configured on the same network and subnet, but with different IPs.

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive homelab environment for cybersecurity enthusiasts, professionals, and students. The lab includes multiple virtual machines with varying operating systems, each serving distinct roles within the security ecosystem. The primary goal is to simulate real-world scenarios where you can safely test tools, protocols, applications, commands, and techniques without the risk of breaking a production environment.

## Tools, Operating Systems, Frameworks, and Languages used:

- VirtualBox
- Windows 10
- Server 2022
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu Linux (CLI version)
- Splunk
- Sysmon
- Atomic Red Team
- MITRE ATT&CK
- MITRE DeTT&CT
- Active Directory Users and Computers
- PowerShell
- Command Prompt

## Why This Project?
This project is an excellent addition to your portfolio because it demonstrates your ability to set up and manage a sophisticated security information and event management (SIEM) environment. Here's what makes it valuable:

* Hands-On Experience: By working with multiple VMs running different OSs (Windows 10, Server 2022, Kali Linux, Ubuntu Linux), you gain practical experience with the tools and techniques used in a real-world security operations center (SOC).

* Versatility: The project's scope covers various responsibilities you might encounter in the industry, such as configuring and managing SIEM tools like Splunk, using Sysmon for enhanced Windows logging, and leveraging open-source tools like Atomic Red Team for simulating attacks.

* Learning and Experimentation: The homelab setup is intentionally kept bare bones, allowing you to build and expand upon it. This flexibility enables you to test different tools and frameworks in a controlled environment. Additionally, it gives you the opportunity to document your findings, improve your reporting skills, and create knowledge-base articles, further enriching your technical writing abilities.
